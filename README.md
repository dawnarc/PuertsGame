You need to edit these TypeScript source file to fire hot swapping of `PuerTS` by adding a blank line is each source file.

If add a blank line and save file, log would output that TypeScript source has been re-compiled:

Then `PuerTS` would auto compile this TypeScript source and auto generate Unreal `.uasset` file under directory `PuertsGame/Blueprints/TypeScript/`.
