+ Copy directory `puerts/unreal/Puerts/` into this project:`PuertsGame/Plugins/Puerts/`.

+ If can't find `TS_BaseGun`, `TS_Player` and `TS_Rifle` in directory `PuertsGame/Blueprints/TypeScript/`, which were generated by `PuerTS`, in editor content browser.

You need to edit these TypeScript source file to fire hot swapping of `PuerTS` by adding a blank line is each source file.

If add a blank line and save file, log would output that TypeScript source has been re-compiled:

Then `PuerTS` would auto compile this TypeScript source and auto generate Unreal `.uasset` file under directory `PuertsGame/Blueprints/TypeScript/`.
