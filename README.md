You need to edit these TypeScript source file to fire hot swapping of `PuerTS` by adding a blank line is each source file.

If add a blank line and save file, then `PuerTS` would auto compile this TypeScript source and auto generate Unreal `.uasset` file under directory `PuertsGame/Blueprints/TypeScript/`
